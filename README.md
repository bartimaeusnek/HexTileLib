# HexTileLib

A simple library that contains some classes which help with creating Hexagonal Grids.   
This is a KISS approach, since many libs out there seemed bloated to me.

Based on [Red Blob Games Guide to Hexagonal Grids.](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/)  
Supports both .NETFramework and .NET, due to multitargeting  
LGPLv3 Licensed.

Uses [Silk.NET Maths](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) as Vector implementation

## Build Status:
